Binary files.

This repo includes files:

1) binary firmware (builded from open source projects)
2) binary programs (builded from open source projects too)

Security:

We try to keep files here reasonably secure, but when ever in doubt,
we recommend strongly to instead to build from sources yourself!

This repo exists mostly for:
- to pass on binary firmware e.g. from more secure build site to place where it will be used by end-users
- windows users
