--- Security ---

We try to keep files here reasonably secure, but when ever in doubt,
we recommend strongly to instead to build from sources yourself!

This repo exists mostly:
- to publish binary programs
- to publish binary firmware e.g. from more secure build site to place where it will be used by end-users
- for tests
- for windows users
